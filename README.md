This repo is a catch-all for various configs on various operating systems. This repository contains:

- My custom neovim configuration
- Custom keymaps (QMK, ZMK, VIA/VIAL, etc) for several keyboards I use
- A messy powershell script to set up my preferred directory structure on new machines
- Several custom git aliases
- probably more. this is always a work in progress
