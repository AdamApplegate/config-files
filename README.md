# dotfiles
This repo is a catch-all for various configs on various operating systems. This repository contains:

- editor configs
- keymaps (QMK, ZMK, VIA/VIAL, etc) for several keyboards I use
- linux & KDE dotfiles
- Windows configs 
- browser startpages

And probably more. This repo is always a work in progress
