# dotfiles
This repo is a catch-all for configs on various operating systems and hardware. The goal is to make setting up new machines easy.

### This repository contains:
- editor configs
- keymaps (QMK, ZMK, VIA/VIAL, etc) for several keyboards I use
- Linux & KDE dotfiles
- Windows configs 
- browser startpages
- misc scripts

And probably more. This repo is always a work in progress.
